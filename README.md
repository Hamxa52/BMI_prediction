# BMI Prediction with Interactive GUI
Problem Statement:
Create an application that calculates BMI and classifies individuals into different weight categories. This application will help users understand their BMI status using a machine learning model.

Datasets:
For this project, you can create a synthetic dataset that includes height, weight, and BMI categories. Alternatively, you can find datasets from health organizations or public repositories.

Algorithms and Techniques:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification
Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
GUI development using Tkinter
Project Proposal:
Problem: Classify individuals into BMI categories based on their height and weight.
Dataset: Synthetic or publicly available health datasets.
Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter.

## Overview
This project calculates BMI and classifies individuals into different weight categories using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. It provides an interactive GUI for users to input their height and weight and get their BMI status.

## Project Structure

1# Data Preprocessing:
> Load or create the dataset
> Calculate BMI and classify into categories
> Feature selection and engineering
2# Model Training:
> Split the dataset into training and testing sets
> Train a KNN classifier
> Validate the model performance
3# GUI Development:
> Create a user-friendly interface with Tkinter
> Allow users to input height and weight
> Display the BMI, category, and prediction result
